Repository just for practice

- everything still work in progress

cpu:
// little endian memory
// instruction size 4 bytes
// instruction pointer (ip) contains instruction address relativ to memory for the next instruction
// program have to be terminated with halt instruction
// seven status registers to control program flow
// register width is two byte
// opcodes always work on registers

assembler:
// two-pass assembler
// first pass implemented
// ...still working on it
